This mod adds a new character, The ___! Featuring:
- 1 card (which is Special rarity and is mostly just there to keep the compendium from crashing)
- 1 Relic
- Your imagination

## Installation Instructions
- Install StsLib, ModTheSpire, BaseMod, EUI, and Fabricate (these can be gotten from the Steam workshop. If you have the GOG version, follow these steps instead: https://reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/gj5kel/howto_add_mods_to_gog_version/)
- Download the mod from the Releases section and place it into your mods folder (usually {folder containing STS}\SlayTheSpire\mods; you will need to create this folder if it doesn't exist)
- Run ModTheSpire. Ensure that StsLib, BaseMod, EUI, and Fabricate are checked and appear above this mod in the mod load order
